line from master.
//test1
Change before branch 2
Saved, but not staged. 

Testcase
**************
What happens when I switch to a new branch while there are pending changes that are not indexed.

Test
********  
switch to master
add an extra line

switch to branch2
see if the extra line is there

//Yes it is there

commit to branch2

switch to master
See if the extra line, which was originally entered on master is there

//No it is not there

Conclusion
*************
Only commited changes are brought back
(including commited deletions)

Uncommited Additions during the switch are kept! 


what did I learn?
